What's up! How are you? My name is Yago Peixinho, I am a student of Information Technology; I'm interested in all areas of technology, from Information Security, Web Development, Mobile, to Artificial Intelligence. I am currently studying full-stack web development, but in the future I intend to expand my horizons in all areas. Feel free to visit my repositories, fork and bookmark, even send me a message on my social networks. Currently I've been studying a lot of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap on the front-end. On the backend my knowledge is PHP and MySQL. I am open to new languages and knowledge.
