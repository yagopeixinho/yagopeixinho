### Hi, I'm Yago Peixinho!
I'm a mid-level developer with expertise in C#, .NET, TypeScript, React, SQL, and MySQL, along with strong knowledge of CSS and preprocessors like SASS. 
I have experience developing mobile applications using React Native and working on artificial intelligence projects with Python. Iâ€™m involved in 
the entire software development lifecycle, covering CI/CD, Git Flow, Azure DevOps, Microsoft Azure, and Docker, with a focus on best practices and 
continuous high-quality delivery through well-structured pipelines.
